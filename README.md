# 0a Interpreter

## About

I tried to create a basic programming language interpreter for a simple language with little features and simple syntax.

Please note that I made this just for fun, and used it to learn more typescript than I already knew.

### Currently Includes

- Simple syntax
- Easy to use custom function system
