# Understanding Variables

Variables are either declared through `val` or as a parameter. The example below declares a global variable, and then logs it's value.

```
val test = testing
log val:test
```

Variables must be declared using `val:` before the name, so that the variable is parsed properly.

To understand variables as parameters for functions, please read [learn functions](/?md/guides/learnfunc.md).
